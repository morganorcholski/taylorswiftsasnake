		<h1 class="title">Kim Kardashian Just Called Taylor Swift a Snake on Twitter</h1>
	</div>

	<div id="container">
		<p class="text"> <img src="../images/kimtweet.jpg" style="width:100%;height:100%;"> After calling out Taylor Swift in a GQ interview last month, Kim Kardashian wants the world to know she has no intentions of backing down anytime soon. In a Keeping Up With the Kardashians clip released earlier this week, the reality star explained that she'd had enough of hearing that Taylor didn't know she would be featured in her husband Kanye West's song, "Famous," so she'd felt she had to stand up for him. Now, she's taking that dedication to the next level with arguably one of the shadiest tweets of all time.</p>

		<p class="text">On Sunday, upon finding out that it's National Snake Day, Kim took to Twitter to not-so-subtly dedicate the holiday to a certain snake in her life. While she doesn't explicitly mention Taylor by name, given the fact that her callout is going to be a major theme on tonight's episode of KUWTK, it's safe to assume the pop star is the snake in question.</p>

		<p class="text">To find out how deep this rabbit (aka snake) hole goes, tune in to Keeping Up With the Kardashians tonight at 9 p.m. on E!.<p>
